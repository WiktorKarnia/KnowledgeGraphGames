## Knowledge Graph Games
A web-based word association game platform developed using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, integrating the Datamuse API to generate word connections. The project includes two distinct games:

- **WordConnect**: A timed challenge where players navigate a path between two words using their synonyms.
- **WordGuess**: A round-based game where players attempt to identify three words associated with a given main word, earning points for correct guesses.
  
Both games feature individual leaderboards, tracking players' performance based on completion time or score.
